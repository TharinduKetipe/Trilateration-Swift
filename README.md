# Trilateration-Swift
This project contains a trilateration algorithm implementation using swift. In geometry, trilateration is the process of determining absolute or 
relative locations of points by measurement of distances, using the geometry of circles, spheres or triangles. 
This algorithm can be used for location based application implemented using GPS and iBeacon technologies. This is the core algorithm used in most of the location base native services. You can optimize this further.
